## CSNF Decorator

### Overview

The CSNF decorator provides context awareness for security events in terms of risk, threat, compliance, asset value. The Cloud consumer can also apply a custom decorator to the event based on their own unique business context, for example a custom decoration based on asset value based on criticality, cost or sensitivity could be applied to the event in order to better contextualize and prioritize response based on business context.

### Contextual Enrichment

The decorator type allows additional context to be added to an individual event from a trusted source without mutating the base event.  There can be multiple decorators applied to the base event. The combination of standardized security events along with correlated knowledge and analytics processing provide new capabilities for the organizations security team to develop and apply fine-grained secuirty policy based on contextual awareness that was previously unknown.
