This page contains information on the Spring 2022 Cloud Security Notification Framework release, code named Birthday Cake. The goal of showing a real-world implementation is to demonstrate the art of the possible. We wanted to try and capture a day in the life of a multi-cloud security operations center or SOC. As we have mentioned before, the SOC is constantly overwhelmed.  Analysts are drowning in security alerts, with far too many threats to investigate and resolve.
