     CSNF: In Scope / Out of Scope
---

### Scope

- The focus of initial iterations is on *data in the Security space*. Other domains (e.g., operational monitoring) may be addressed in the future.
- Need to think of cloud services from the context of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS and focus on data from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).
- CSPs include not only Cloud Providers like Azure, Amazon, Google, but also security solutions / services from Symantec, Microsoft Defender for ATP, etc.
- The initial effort is scoped to documenting the common taxonomy.
- Format of the taxonomy is scoped to json or others (Syslog, CEF)? [Where do we get the broadest market adoption- can we be format
  agnostic?\]

### Out of Scope

- The specific technology as to how do these CSPs protect security perimeter.
- Security Solutions not protecting cloud workloads.
- Updating CSPs to include the common taxonomy is not in scope. \[CSPs can update at their own pace as needed at least foundational elements\]
- *Potential future scope* â€“Tooling for compliance certification to the published taxonomy
