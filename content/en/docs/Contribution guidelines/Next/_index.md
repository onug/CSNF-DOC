ONUG Contributor License Agreement
```
In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions (defined below in Section
1 ) from any person or entity, ONUG must have a Contributor License Agreement (this “Agreement”) on
file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This
license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of ONUG and its users; it does not
change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

This Agreement allows an entity (the "Corporation") to submit Contributions to ONUG, to authorize
Contributions submitted by its designated employees to ONUG, and to grant copyright and patent licenses
thereto.

Please complete and sign this Agreement and then email a pdf file of this Agreement to Scott Kargman at
scott@onug.net. Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions
submitted to ONUG. Except for the license granted herein to ONUG and recipients of software distributed
by ONUG, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

**1. Definitions.**

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that
is making this Agreement with ONUG. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other
entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to
be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii)
ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
entity.

"Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation or other original works of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to ONUG for inclusion
in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the ONUG (the "Work"). For the
purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
sent to ONUG or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, ONUG


for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously
marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

**2. Grant of Copyright License.**

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to ONUG and to recipients of
software distributed by ONUG a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

**3. Grant of Patent License.**

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to ONUG and to recipients of
software distributed by ONUG a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that
are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s)alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the
Work to which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You
or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution,
or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

**4. Authorizations.**

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. You represent further that each
employee of the Corporation designated on Schedule A below (or in a subsequent written modification
to that Schedule) is authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the Corporation.

**5. Original Work.**

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on
behalf of others).

**6. No Support; Warranty Disclaimer.**

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide
support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

**7. Contributions of Others.**

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to ONUG separately
from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
(including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are
personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named
here]".


**8. Designated Employees**.

It is your responsibility to notify ONUG when any change is required to the list of designated employees
authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the Corporation, or to the Corporation's Point of Contact
with ONUG.
